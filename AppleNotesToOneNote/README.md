# Apple Notes to OneNote

Script Editor is required to run this script. Additionally you'll need to elevate to admin to 
grant permissions for the first time

This scripts will go through each Apple notes and copy their content into a new OneNote page.
The bulk importing will take some time as it must go one note at a time. The import will create
HTML files that will be saved in a created folder on the Desktop, as well as a text file with a
list of notes that couldn't be imported due to its file size.
